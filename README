HTTPSQS is a Simple Queue Service based on HTTP GET/POST protocol.
This is free software, and you are welcome to modify and redistribute it under the New BSD License.

This is a fork of Zhang Yan's original HTTPSQS project with an aim to clean up and modularize
code so new backend storage types can be experimented with.

The current revision users YDB instead of Tokyo Cabinet.

Changes in this fork:
---------------------
 * All informational responses are in JSON
 * UIDs are 64bit integers, rather than the original cyclic IDs
 * Queue information is stored in-memory and not persisted

Features which will be implemented:
-----------------------------------
 * Pluggable storage backends allowing for YDB, TokyoCabinet, filesystem etc.
 * Queue information will be persisted, allowing for restarts & crashes
